          Coding chatbot is the first big project of my life. It all start from
          watching Iron man's jarvis. He has pretty cool assistant and everyone
          wan't something like jarvis that why i start to code one.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it's also good for my resume too. I can take all of my small
          projects and put them into my new assistant like features. I started
          this project the end of my 1<sup>st</sup> year of college. It's{" "}
          <b>2021</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I start watching YouTube videos about virtual assistant with
          implementing them. Almost all of the YouTubers are writing a long{" "}
          <b>if...then...else...</b> ladder something like <b>if</b> i say play
          song <b>then</b> play songs <b>else</b> do nothing. You can see the
          full source code{" "}

          </a>
          I wrote more than 3000 lines of code. then is start optimizing code
          and fixing issues like what if someone say <b>open youtube</b> or{" "}
          <b>open youtube and play Trending songs</b>. Here Both starts with{" "}
          <b>open youtube</b> but the action taken by the assistant have to be
          different. I start fixing lots of bug's errors and optimizing the code
          as much i can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just Before my 1<sup>st</sup> year exams i end up with almost 1000
          line of code. And a major thing i learned at that time is that you can
          find small and common things on youtube easily But when it commes to
          creating something for your own you have to{" "}
          <b>build your own logic </b>. Mybe my code is just a peice of sh!ts in
          2022 but it's my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never stop improving <b>Grace.</b> Btw Grace is the name of my
          assistant even while my exams are running like what if we add power of
          maching learning, or what if we add this code into <b>raspberry pi</b>{" "}
          and make soemting like alexa.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the end of my exams i start code again and starts re-designing
          the whole project because i want power of neural networks. So Grace
          can understand and relate human language more easily and effecitely. I
          start researching, implementing. I read lot of Documentations as i
          can. Did everything i can and after 1 year of progress I endup with my
          brand new Assistant which is{" "}
          <b>
            now capable to understand human voice and can did Lot'ssssss of
            things now.
          </b>{" "}
          I wirte some features in my Github repo's readme.me file also
