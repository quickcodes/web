          Coding chatbot is the first big project of my life. It all start from
          watching Iron man's jarvis. He has pretty cool assistant and everyone
          wan't something like jarvis that why i start to code one.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it's also good my resume too. I can take all of my small projects
          and put them into my new assistant like features.
