                        Heraclitus, a philosopher born in the Persian Empire
                        back in the fifth century BC, had it right when he wrote
                        about men on the battlefield. “Out of every one hundred
                        men,” he wrote, “ten shouldn&rsquo;t even be there, eighty are
                        just targets, nine are the real fighters, and we are
                        lucky to have them, for they make the battle. Ah, but

                        lives to fuel the big ones. Think of your small
                        accomplishments as kindling. When you want a bonfire,
                        you don&rsquo;t start by lighting a big log. You collect some
                        witch&rsquo;s hair—a small pile of hay or some dry, dead
                        grass. You light that, and then add small sticks and
                        bigger sticks before you feed your tree stump into the
                        blaze. Because it&rsquo;s the small sparks, which start small
                        fires, that eventually build enough heat to burn the
                        whole fucking forest down.
